### ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES

Our application, Saverapp, is an application intended for young students. 
The intention is for the users to enter their monthly budget and the percentage of money they would like to save at the end of each month from their budget. They will also need to insert the areas in which they typically spend their money, and the percentage of their money they would like to spend in each area. The program sets a limit figure for spending in each area. The program then asks the user for their daily expenses and creates a table with the money they have spent in each area and how much is left to reach their limit figure.


This project is very useful for students who live abroad or even at home to better manage their money, be aware of their expenses and help them save money.
